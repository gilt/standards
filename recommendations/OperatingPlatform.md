# Operating Platform

## Adopt

  - Amazon Linux
  - CentOS
  - Ubuntu

## Trial

  - [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
  We are no longer limited to Operation Systems on EC2 nodes (or elsewhere). Several teams have, successfully, utilized AWS Lambda for some use cases to enter the world of serverless computing for simple and short-lived operations. Special attention should be taken with Java/Scala, as there may be latency problems under slow "warmups" under some circumstances.
