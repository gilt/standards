      We feel that, despite its 80s-ish look and feel, we could
      benefit from its very low cpu/memory footprint, "batteries
      included" philosophy and fast development turn-around to write
      simple services not requiring the full power of Types and FP and
      for CPU intensive tasks. Is it worth notice that it really
      shines combined with an ECS+Docker deploy.
